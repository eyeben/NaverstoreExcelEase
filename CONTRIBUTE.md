## Project Structure

`NaverstoreExcelEase` is a web-based Excel file processing tool implemented using JavaScript and HTML. The main components are as follows:

- `appNaverstoreExcelEase.html`: Defines the user interface. This file includes buttons for uploading Excel files and processing them.
- `scriptNaverstoreExcelEase.js`: Contains the core JavaScript logic for reading and processing Excel files. This script reads files, processes data, and creates a new Excel file for download.

## File Naming Conventions

- HTML files: `app` + `Project Name`. Example: `appNaverstoreExcelEase.html`
- JavaScript files: `script` + `Project Name`. Example: `scriptNaverstoreExcelEase.js`

These rules help maintain consistency within the project files and easily identify the purpose of each file.
